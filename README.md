# wood_cutting_calculator
A Board Cutting Calculator for Woodworking Projects.

- Enter the rectangular dimensions of the individual wooden parts you want to cut out of the boards (thickness/width/height/material) and the quantity of each.
- Enter the wooden boards you are thinking of purchasing (thickness/width/height/material).
- Add a tolerance (cutting kerf + throw-away width) for the parts -- for example 1/4 inch extra space may be assumed around each part.

The calculator will determine whether the parts can be cut out of the boards, recommended placements for each part, and recommend a minimum size for the boards.
